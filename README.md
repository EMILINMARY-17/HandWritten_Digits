# Handwritten Digits Classification

This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify handwritten digits from the popular MNIST dataset. The goal is to build and evaluate models that can accurately recognize digits (0–9) from image pixel data.

## Problem Statement
Digit recognition is a key part of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) used in postal systems, bank cheque processing, and automated data entry. The MNIST dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits which are to be classified into one of the 10 categories (0–9).

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA & Visualization)
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (optional if used)

## Algorithms Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) *(if used)*
- Naive Bayes *(if used)*

## **Best Accuracy Achieved**: `96.94%` using **KNN**

## Project Workflow
1. Loaded MNIST dataset
2. Visualized sample digits and pixel distribution
3. Performed data preprocessing and feature scaling
4. Trained multiple models and compared accuracy
5. Evaluated performance using confusion matrix and classification report

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells step by step
